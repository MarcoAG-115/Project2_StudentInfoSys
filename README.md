# Student Information System

"Student information will be stored in a database and can be accessed anytime online. Updated only by authorized personnel, such as instructor or administrator. Student / parent / guardian / authorized person with valid credentials should be able to only view the grades. Organize the grades by semester, different possible grades are Withdraw-W, Pass-P, No Pass-N, Incomplete-I, and letter grades â€“ A, B, C, D, F. If Incomplete for more than a year, it will be automatically changed to F. Instructor can change grades only for current semester, and not for any of the prior ones. The system should track and provide information such as number of credits completed by students, remaining credits to graduate, minor degree credits completed so far, etc. Only P, A, B, and C grades are considered satisfactory, other are not considered as completed. Each course has X number of credits. Calculate GPA, minor GPA."

This program is demo / prototype created by translating software models and designs. The main features from the project description presented above are included in the program through the use of text files that act as a database.

## Installation

Download the the zip file that contains all the repository files and unzip in a desired location.

## Usage

Open the files in an editor or IDE capable of running Java and any of its toolkits, such as Java Swing. Run the program and use the existing administrator and student logins found in StudentLogins.txt or AdminLogins.txt. New logins can be added manually by editing these text files. For testing certain features like displaying grades, utilize the existing student logins or create a new student and add courses, along with corresponding info, before attempting to display their info.
